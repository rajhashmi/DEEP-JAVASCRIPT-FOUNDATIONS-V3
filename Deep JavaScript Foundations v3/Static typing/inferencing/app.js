// beifit to use TypeScript 

// 1. catch type-related mistakes;

// One of the primary reasons to use TypeScript is its strong static typing. TypeScript allows you to define explicit types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch type-related errors at compile time rather than at runtime, leading to more reliable and predictable code.

// 2. Commmunication type intent;

// TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means you can gradually adopt TypeScript in an existing JavaScript project. You can start by adding type annotations to existing JavaScript code and then gradually refactor and incorporate more advanced TypeScript features.

// 3. Privide IDE feedback;

// TypeScript provides enhanced support for modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code. The type information helps IDEs offer intelligent code completion, better error highlighting, and improved refactoring tools, which can significantly boost developer productivity.

// ******    Caveats    ********;

// 1.  inferencing is best-guess, not a guarantee

// 2. Annotation are opptional

//  Any part of the application that isn't typed introduced uncretainty
