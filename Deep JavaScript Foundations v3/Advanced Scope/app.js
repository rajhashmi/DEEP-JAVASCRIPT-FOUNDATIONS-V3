// lexical scopes & Dynamic scops :->

// Lexical Scope (Static Scope):

// 1. Lexical scope determines the scope of a variable based on its position in the source code's hierarchical structure.

// 2. Scope is determined at compile time and remains fixed throughout the code's execution.

// 3. Variables are accessed based on the nesting of functions or blocks in the code.

// 4. Each inner scope has access to variables from its parent scope, but not vice versa.
