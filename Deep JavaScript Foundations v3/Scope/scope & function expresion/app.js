//  what is function expression 
// when we assign a function it is powerfull tool be can use this function a argument;

function teacher(){
    // *********8
}

let myTeacher = function anotherTeacher(){
    console.log(anotherTeacher);
}
console.log(teacher);
console.log(myTeacher);
console.log(anotherTeacher);

//  the anotherTeacher is end up as marble in  at compile time
//  function expression  put there identifyer into there the ownscope


//  name function expression when in the statement the first word is function is called function expression

//  name function expression is more better than annoumous function expresion 

// 1. Reliable function self-refercence (recursion, etc);

// it's help us in recursive 

// 2. we make our code debuggable.

// 3. our code become more documentible 
// for example we have annoumous function when we see to it for what happening in it we could't understand that code by just see the annoumous  styntax we have see in body to understand so that way we use naming expression


// NOTE :-> dont ever use arrow function just for it's short && it's anounomous


// summary 

// NAME Function dDeclaration  > Named Function Expresion > Anonymous Function Expression 

// 1. NAME Function declaration have superiour  and its have some benifits over names function expression and   Named Function Expresion have huge benifite over Anonymous Function Expression
